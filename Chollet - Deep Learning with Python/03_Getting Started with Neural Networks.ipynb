    "- **Dense Layers**: Simple vector data stored in 2D tensors of shape (samples, features) is often processed by densely connected layers, also called fully connected or dense layers (the Dense class in Keras).\n",

    "- **Recurrent Layers**: Sequence data stored in 3D tensors of shape (samples, timesteps, features), is typically processed by recurrent layers such as an LSTM layer.\n",
