    "Born in the 1950s. Early chess programs only involved hardcoded rules crafted by programmers, and didn't qualify as machine learning. At the time experts believed that human-level artificial intelligence could only be achieved by having programmers handcraft a sufficiently large set of explicit rules. This approach is called **symbolic AI**, and was the dominant paradigm in AI to the late 1980s. \n",

    "Although symbolic AI proved suitable to solve well-defined, logical problems, it turned out to be intractable to figure out explicit rules for solving more complex problems such as image classification, speech recognition, and language translation."
