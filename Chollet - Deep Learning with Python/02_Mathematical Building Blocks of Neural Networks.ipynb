We’ll use the MNIST dataset, a classic in the machine-learning community, which has been around almost as long as the field itself and has been intensively studied.

For instance, the previous matrix example has shape (3, 5), and the 3D tensor example has shape (3, 3, 5). A vector has a shape with a single element, such as (5,), whereas a scalar has an empty shape, ().\n",
