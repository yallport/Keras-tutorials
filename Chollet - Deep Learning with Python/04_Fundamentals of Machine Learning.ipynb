    "\n",
    "Supervised learning consists of learning to map input data to known targets (also called **annotations**), given a set of examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning mostly consists of classification and regression, but there are also the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sequence generation**: Given a picture, predict a caption describing it. Sequence generation can sometimes be reformulated as a series of classification problems (such as repeatedly predicting a word or token in a sequence).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Syntax tree prediction**: Given a sentence, predict its decomposition into a syntax tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Object detection**: Given a picture, draw a bounding box around certain objects inside the picture. This can also be expressed as a classification problem (given many candidate bounding boxes, classify the contents of each one) or as a joint classification and regression problem, where the bounding-box coordinates are predicted via vector regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Image segmentation**: Given a picture, draw a pixel-level mask on a specific object.\n",

    "In reinforcement learning, an **agent** receives information about its environment and learns to choose actions that will maximize some reward. For instance, a neural network that \"looks\" at a video game screen and outputs game actions in order to maximize its score can be trained via reinforcement learning.\n",

In time, however, we expect to see rein- forcement learning take over an increasingly large range of real-world applications: self-driving cars, robotics, resource management, education, and so on.\n",

    "- **Sample** or **input**: One data point that goes into your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prediction** or **output**: What comes out of your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Target**: The truth. What your model should ideally have predicted, according to an external source of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prediction error** or **loss value**: A measure of the distance between your model’s prediction and the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Classes**: A set of possible labels to choose from in a classification problem. For example, when classifying cat and dog pictures, “dog” and “cat” are the two classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Label**: A specific instance of a class annotation in a classification problem. For instance, if picture #1234 is annotated as containing the class “dog,” then “dog” is a label of picture #1234.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ground-truth** or **annotations**: All targets for a dataset, typically collected by humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Binary classification**: A classification task where each input sample should be categorized into two exclusive categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multiclass classification**: A classification task where each input sample should be categorized into more than two categories: for instance, classifying handwritten digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multilabel classification**: A classification task where each input sample can be assigned multiple labels. For instance, a given image may contain both a cat and a dog and should be annotated both with the “cat” label and the “dog” label. The number of labels per image is usually variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scalar regression**: A task where the target is a continuous scalar value. Pre- dicting house prices is a good example: the different target prices form a con- tinuous space.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vector regression**: A task where the target is a set of continuous values: for example, a continuous vector. If you’re doing regression against multiple val- ues (such as the coordinates of a bounding box in an image), then you’re doing vector regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mini-batch** or **batch**: A small set of samples (typically between 8 and 128) that are processed simultaneously by the model. The number of samples is often a power of 2, to facilitate memory allocation on GPU. When training, a mini-batch is used to compute a single gradient-descent update applied to the weights of the model.\n",
